# Ice

Ice is a compiled language with pythonic code blocks and some unique features.

[The wiki](../../wiki) lists all details.

Refer [this test file](Examples/Test%20file.ice) for some syntax examples.

[Contributions are welcome!](../../discussions/9)

## Roadmap
The goal is to be able to compile from source to binary after the addition of each feature.\
These are the features in order:
- [ ] Basic expressions and assignments\
    *"var", "function(args)", "var.method(args)", "var op var"*
    - [x] Parse expressions
    - [x] Parse declarations
    - [x] Builtin functions
    - [ ] Integer literals
- [ ] Array literals
- [ ] String literals
- [ ] Control flow statements
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Labels (definitions and assignments)
- [ ] Advanced expressions\
    *Here weâ€™ll have more complex expressions with operator precedence and all*
- [ ] Advanced assignments\
    *Basically unpacking*
- [ ] Structs

## Installation
This project isn't an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) yet, so none of that.
